\section{Related Work}

\anote{This must be one of the largest sections. Actually there have been many attempts before us to formalize UC from the PL and formal verification side. }

UC was originally developed and most widely used by cryptographers, in the development of multi-party computation.

\subsection{Extension of (and alternatives to) UC in Cryptography.}

The IITM model.
Agents model from this year. Instead of multi-party computation, good for certain kinds of proofs ().

This is also based on 

Commit-and-Prove, introduces a composition operator presented. In both cases, these are cryptographic zero knowledge proofs.

\paragraph{Formalizations of UC.}

Backes et al.

\paragraph{Symbolic UC.} Uses Pi calculus, with a nondeterministic semantics, as its backend. It cannot directly be instantiated with cryptographic primitives.

\paragraph{CoSP.} CoSP is a framework used in several works (anonymous web of trust) as an underlying framework for Zero knowledge proofs.
